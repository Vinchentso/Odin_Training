<h3>Lasagne Verdi alla Bolognese</h3>
<p>
  This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of
  Commerce.
</p>
<p>
  I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as
  which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. One thing
  never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The
  ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using
  fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.

<h4>Ingradients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
  <li>A half cup diced carrot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has
    rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir
    until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
    Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles,
    until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir;
    pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow
    steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
  </li>
</ol>
